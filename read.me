# 🏭 FactoryApp – Internal Factory Management Platform

FactoryApp is a Django-based web application developed as part of the final project for the Django Advanced course at SoftUni. It simulates an internal platform for a real-world factory environment, where employees and managers collaborate through suggestions and scheduled inspections. The project showcases full-stack development using Django, with role-based access control, reusable components, and clean modular structure.
